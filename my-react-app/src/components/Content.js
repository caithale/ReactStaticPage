      <p>Cinderella lived with her Step-Mother and Step-Sisters and was forced to work as a maid without complaint.
        One day she meets her fairy godmother who allows her to go to the ball where she meets the prince. The prince
        falls in love with Cinderella while at the ball. When the clock strikes midnight, Cinderella escapes but leaves
        a glass slipper behind in her haste. The prince searches far and wide to find whoever fits the shoe, eventually
        ending up at the Step-Mothers house. The Step-Mother locks Cinderella away but is soon discovered by the Prince.
